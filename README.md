# dist-sys-in-flask

This is a single page application displaying information about Distributed Systems and Lamport's Clock.
This is built using **Python's Flask** web micro framework and the application will be containerized using **Docker** before becoming available to general public on Google Cloud Platform.

This project has been built as a demonstration for my portfolio on Google Cloud Platform that I had written for my Cloud Computing course during the 6th semester of my B.Tech in Comp. Sci.
